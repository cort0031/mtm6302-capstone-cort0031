## Pokedex
Using the PokeApi, you will design and develop a Pokedex web application that will display a gallery of pokemon with images. Users should be able to choose to load more pokemon, view details about a specific pokemon, and mark pokemon as "caught".

## Mockup Design
The mockup added to this repository includes the sprites of the first 150 pokemon, including number and types. After clicking the pokemon, it will show the pokemon in detail and data that the PokeAPI has in the database such as abilities, moves, stats and types.
